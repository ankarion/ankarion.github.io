Yep, you can easily iterate through the jsonb with this magical thing.
Let's imagine that you have an incoming Jsonb:
'{"1":"1","2":["2","2"],"3":3,"4":{"1":4}}'::jsonb
(which is actually comming in JsonbContainer format)

First of all, it is needed to initialize jsonb iterator. You can do it with the function:
JsonbIterator *it = JsonbIteratorInit(jsonb);//where jsonb - is an incoming jsonb in *JsonbContainer format.

Then, iterating through it will be as simple as cycle:
for(JsonbIteratorToken r=JsonbIteratorNext(&it,&v,true),r!=WJB_DONE,r=JsonbIteratorNext(&it,&v,true))
Looks scary, but actually this means that:
we start iterating through an object with "r" equal to result of JsonbIteratorNext.
So, what does this function do?
JsonbIteratorNext gets iterator(&it) and puts next iteration element into v
